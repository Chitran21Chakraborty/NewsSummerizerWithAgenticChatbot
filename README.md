 LangGraph AgenticAI – Streamlit App

LangGraph AgenticAI is a modern AI-powered application that combines graph-based reasoning, LLMs, and an interactive Streamlit UI to deliver three key features:

 News Summarizer – Summarize news from the last 1, 7, or 30 days.

 Web Search – Search the web and retrieve structured results.

 Agentic Chatbot – Chat with an AI agent powered by a configurable LLM and reasoning graphs.

Built on top of Streamlit and modular components (GroqLLM, GraphBuilder, custom UI modules), this project makes agentic AI systems both accessible and extensible.
